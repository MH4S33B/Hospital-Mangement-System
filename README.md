## ✨ Features
✔ CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for patient records

✔ Search patients by ID or name

✔ Persistent data storage (saves to patients.dat)

✔ Input validation (age, duplicate IDs)

✔ Clean console UI with menu navigation

## 🚀 Getting Started
###Prerequisites
C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

###Compilation & Execution
```bash
    g++ hospital_management.cpp -o hospital_management
    ./hospital_management
```
## 📂 Project Structure
```
├── hospital_management.cpp  # Main source code  
├── patients.dat            # Patient database (auto-generated)  
└── README.md               # Documentation  
```

## 🖥️ Usage
- Add Patient: Enter ID, name, age, disease, and contact

- View Records: Display all stored patients

- Update/Delete: Modify or remove entries
