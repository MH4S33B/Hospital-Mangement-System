Hospital Management System in C++

A console-based Hospital Management System built in C++ to efficiently manage patient records with file storage capabilities.

✨ Features
✔ CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for patient records
✔ Search patients by ID or name
✔ Persistent data storage (saves to patients.dat)
✔ Input validation (age, duplicate IDs)
✔ Clean console UI with menu navigation

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

Compilation & Execution
  bash
    g++ hospital_management.cpp -o hospital_management
    ./hospital_management
📂 Project Structure
├── hospital_management.cpp  # Main source code  
├── patients.dat            # Patient database (auto-generated)  
└── README.md               # Documentation  

🖥️ Usage
Add Patient: Enter ID, name, age, disease, and contact
View Records: Display all stored patients
